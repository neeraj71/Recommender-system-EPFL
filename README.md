### Organization of the folder:
* **source code** :
    * run.py : python script that creates the best prediction achieved.
    * baselines.py : functions for general_mean, user_means and item_means baselines.
    * cross_validation.py : implementation of cross_validation methods in the case of a recommender system.
    * helpers.py, plots.py : provided in the lab10
    * utils.py : useful functions to read files, write predictions to file, initialize matrix factorization methods, 
    and compute prediction error.
    * matrix_factorization.py functions to perform ALS and SGD matrix factorization
    *neural_net.py : implementation of multi-layer-perceptron
